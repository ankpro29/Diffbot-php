They provide better experiences for customers, approach the job with energy—which enhances productivity—and come up with creative product, process and service improvements. They remain with their employers for longer tenures, which reduces turnover and its related costs.

A big reason for this superior performance is that engaged employees direct their energies toward the right tasks and outcomes. Compensation and benefits still matter to them, of course. But when it comes to engagement, other characteristics of the workplace matter even more: a strong sense of purpose, ample autonomy, opportunity for growth, and a sense of affiliation. As one employee of online retailer Zappos put it, “The golden rule is the way of life here.”\nRelated:Earn Customer Loyalty Without Losing Your Shirt\nWhile the benefits of high engagement are clear, there''s no doubt that it''s tough to achieve. Among a broad group of global companies Bain surveyed in late 2010, only a minority of employees (34% in North America and 19% in Europe) said they would recommend working at their company to a friend or relative.\nFor the companies that get it right, customer advocacy can yield a big financial payoff. In the telecommunications industry, for example, boosting customer advocacy by a few percentage points translates into hundreds of millions of dollar in customer base value for a large provider by reducing customer churn and increasing share of wallet with loyal customers.\nSo how do engagement leaders do it? Simply put, they act differently. They regularly solicit feedback from customers and use that feedback to change business processes in ways that both empower employees and increase customer advocacy. At JetBlue Airways, staff members use customer feedback to focus intensively on making the customer''s life easier, and customers repay the effort by spreading the word to others. That has contributed to JetBlue''s No. 1 ranking, for seven consecutive years, in J.D. Power and Associates'' North America Airline Satisfaction Study for the low-cost carrier category.\nLoyalty leaders also work hard to listen to disgruntled customers and contact them, usually within 24 hours after the initial survey. At Charles Schwab, for instance, comments from customers, delivered quickly and in detail to financial consultants and other frontline employees, provide the basis for constructive criticism. Employees can learn, adjust their behavior and take appropriate action with the customer.\nPerformance metrics can be powerful incentives to change employee behavior. Rate employees along metrics of time or cost, and they will respond in kind, even if cutting cost makes for a poor customer experience. Many call centers, for instance, have structured their performance reviews around cost-driven metrics such as “average handle time” for calls. When representatives then try to keep calls as short as possible, they''re unable to solve complicated customer problems, driving up the number of repeat customer calls and the level of customer frustration.\nCompanies that focus on building loyalty adjust their metrics to promote customer advocacy rather than low costs at any price. At Belgacom, a telecommunications provider in Belgium, the call center switched from using average handle time to a combination of two metrics, one on customer promotion and another on resolving the issue on the first call. Previously, a difficult case would get transferred to phone-tree purgatory; with the new system in place, a representative had the power to raise her hand for a nearby technical expert to join the call. Not only did the new approach help to reduce the overall volume of calls by 20%, it also ignited higher customer advocacy scores and employee engagement scores.\nAlong with listening closely, engagement masters encourage, or even mandate, cross-functional collaboration. JetBlue promotes a system of “desired behaviors” that foster a collaborative work environment to improve customer service. For example, the airline encourages pilots, flight attendants and gate agents to work together to help clean the main cabin, which reconciles potential conflict between cabin cleanliness and speed of turnaround between flights, as the aircraft crew is responsible for both.\nThis does not mean “anything goes”. The most effective companies give employees decision rights and accountabilities for daily operational decisions that can add or destroy a lot of value – but within an explicit decision framework that has clear guidelines for behavior. Higher decision effectiveness has a strong correlation with greater employee engagement, Bain research shows.\nBuilding and sustaining high levels of customer advocacy hinge on earning the trust and enthusiasm of employees.

But what he never says is "thank you" – to the American people – for the federal bailout of Bain & Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible.\nAccording to the candidate''s mythology, Romney took leave of his duties at the private equity firm Bain Capital in 1990 and rode in on a white horse to lead a swift restructuring of Bain & Company, preventing the collapse of the consulting firm where his career began. When The Boston Globe reported on the rescue at the time of his Senate run against Ted Kennedy, campaign aides spun Romney as the wizard behind a "long-shot miracle," bragging that he had "saved bank depositors all over the country $30 million when he saved Bain & Company."\nIn fact, government documents on the bailout obtained by Rolling Stone show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie. The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney''s initial rescue attempt at Bain & Company was actually a disaster – leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had "no value as a going concern." Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC – the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers – out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds.\nWith his selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Romney has made fiscal stewardship the centerpiece of his campaign. A banner at MittRomney.com declared, "We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in." Romney also opposed the federal bailout for Detroit automakers, famously arguing that the industry should be forced into bankruptcy. Government bailouts, he insists, are "the wrong way to go."\nMore: Romney Is Lying. Again.\nBut the FDIC documents on the Bain deal – which were heavily redacted by the firm prior to release – show that as a wealthy businessman, Romney was willing to go to extremes to secure a federal bailout to serve his own interests. He had a lot at stake, both financially and politically. Had Bain & Company collapsed, insiders say, it would have dealt a grave setback to Bain Capital, where Romney went on to build a personal fortune valued at as much as $250 million. It would also have short-circuited his political career before it began, tagging Romney as a failed businessman unable to rescue his own firm.\n"None of us wanted to see Bain be the laughingstock of the business world," recalls a longtime Romney lieutenant who asked not to be identified. "But Mitt''s reputation was on the line."\nMitt Romney''s Federal Bailout: The Documents\nThe trouble began in 1984, when Bain & Company spun off Bain Capital to engage in leveraged buyouts and put Romney in charge of the new operation. To free up money to invest in the new business, founder Bill Bain and his partners cashed out much of their stock in the consulting firm – leaving it saddled with about $200 million in debt. (Romney, though not a founder, reportedly profited from the deal.) "People will tell you that Bill raped the place clean, was greedy, didn''t know when to stop," a former Bain consultant later conceded. "Did they take too much out of the firm? You bet."\nThe FDIC documents make clear what happened next: "Soon after the founders sold their equity," analysts reported, "business began to drop off." First came scandal: In the late 1980s, a Bain consultant became a key figure in an illegal stock manipulation scheme in London. The firm''s reputation took a hit, and it fired 10 percent of its consulting force. By the time the 1989 recession began, Bain & Company found itself going broke fast. Cash flows weren''t enough to service the debt imposed by the founders, and the firm could barely make payroll. In a panic, Bill Bain tapped Romney, his longtime protégé, to take the reins.\nTo read the new issue of Rolling Stone online, plus the entire RS archive: Click Here\nIn Romney''s own retelling, he casts himself as a selfless and loyal company man. "There was no upside," he told his cheerleading biographer Hugh Hewitt in 2007. "There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great things for me."\nIn fact, Romney had a direct stake in the survival of Bain & Company: He had been working to build the Bain brand his entire career, and felt he had to save the firm at all costs. After all, Bain sold top-dollar strategic advice to big businesses about how to protect themselves from going bust. If Bain & Company went bankrupt, recalls the Romney deputy, "anyone associated with them would have looked clownish." Indeed, when a banker from Goldman Sachs urged Bain to consider bankruptcy as the obvious solution to the firm''s woes, Romney''s desperation began to show. He flatly refused to discuss it – and in the ensuing argument, one witness says, Romney almost ended up in a brawl when the Goldman banker advised him to "go fuck yourself." For the sake of Romney''s career and fortune, bankruptcy was simply not an option – no matter who got screwed in the process.\nAccording to the government records obtained by Rolling Stone, Bain & Company "defaulted on its debt obligations" at nearly the same time that "W. Mitt Romney . . . stepped in as managing director (and later chief executive) in 1990 and led the financial restructuring intended to get the firm back on track."\nRomney moved decisively, and his early efforts appeared promising. He persuaded the founders to return $25 million of the cash they had raided from Bain & Company and forgive $75 million in debt, in return for protection from most future liabilities. Romney then consolidated Bain''s massive debts into a single, binding loan agreement with four banks, which received liens on Bain''s assets and agreed to delay repayments on the firm''s debts for two years. The federal government also signed off on the deal, since the FDIC had recently taken control of a bank that was owed $30.6 million by Bain. Romney assured creditors that the restructuring would enable Bain to "operate normally, compensate its professionals competitively" and, ultimately, pay off its debts.\nAlmost as soon as the FDIC agreed to the loan restructuring, however, Romney''s rescue plan began to fall apart. "The company realized early on that it would be unable to hit its revenue targets or manage the debt structure," the documents reveal. By the spring of 1992, Bain''s decline was perilous: "If Bain goes into default," one analyst warned the FDIC, "the bank group will need to decide whether to force Bain into bankruptcy."\nWith his rescue plan a bust, Romney was forced to slink back to the banks to negotiate a new round of debt relief. There was only one catch: Even though Bain & Company was deep in debt and sinking fast, the firm was actually flush with cash – most of it from the looted money that Bill Bain and other partners had given back. "Liquidity is strong based on the significant cash balance which Bain is carrying," one federal document reads.\nUnder normal circumstances, such ample reserves would have made liquidating Bain an attractive option: Creditors could simply divvy up the stockpiled cash and be done with the troubled firm. But Bain had inserted a poison pill in its loan agreement with the banks: Instead of being required to use its cash to pay back the firm''s creditors, the money could be pocketed by Bain executives in the form of fat bonuses – starting with VPs making $200,000 and up. "The company can deplete its cash balances by making officer-bonus payments," the FDIC lamented, "and still be in compliance with the loan documents."\nWhat''s more, the bonus loophole gave Romney a perverse form of leverage: If the banks and the FDIC didn''t give in to his demands and forgive much of Bain''s debts, Romney would raid the firm''s coffers, pushing it into the very bankruptcy that the loan agreement had been intended to avert. The losers in this game would not only be Bain''s creditors – including the federal government – but the firm''s nearly 1,000 employees worldwide.\nIn March 1992, according to the FDIC documents, Romney approached the banks and played the bonus card. Allow Bain to pay off its debt at a deep discount, he demanded – just 35 cents on the dollar. Otherwise, the "majority" of the firm''s "excess cash" would "be available for the bonus pool to its officers at a vice president level and above."\nThe next month, when the banks balked at the deal, Romney decided to prove he wasn''t bluffing. "As the bank group did not accept the proposal from Bain," the records show, "Bain''s senior management has decided to go forth with the distribution of bonuses." (Bain''s lawyers redacted the amount of the executive payouts, and the Romney campaign refused to comment on whether Romney himself received a bonus.)\nRomney''s decision to place executive compensation over fiscal responsibility immediately put Bain on the ropes. By that July, FDIC analysts reported, Bain had so little money left that "the company will actually run out of cash and default on the existing debt structure" as early as 1995. If that happened, Bain employees and American consumers would take the hit – an alternative that analysts considered "catastrophic."\nBut Romney didn''t dole out all of Bain''s cash as bonuses right away. According to a record from May 1992, he set aside some of the money to put one last squeeze on the firm''s creditors. Romney now demanded that the banks and the government agree to a deal that was even less favorable than the last – to retire Bain''s debts "at a price up to but not exceeding 30 cents on the dollar."\nThe FDIC considered finding a buyer to take over its loans to Bain, but analysts concluded that "Bain has no value as a going concern." And the government wasn''t likely to get much out of Bain if it allowed the firm to go bankrupt: The loan agreement engineered by Romney had left the FDIC "virtually unsecured" on the $30.6 million it was owed by Bain. "Once bonuses are paid," the analysts warned, "all members of the bank group believe this company will dissolve during 1993."\nAbout the only assets left would be Bain''s office equipment. The records show FDIC analysts pathetically attempting to assess the value of such items, including an HP LaserJet printer, before concluding that most of the gear was so old that the government''s "portion of any liquidation proceeds would be negligible."\nHow had Romney scored such a favorable deal at the FDIC''s expense? It didn''t hurt that he had close ties to the agency – the kind of "crony capitalism" he now decries. A month before he closed the 1991 loan agreement, Romney promoted a former FDIC bank examiner to become a senior executive at Bain. He also had pull at the top: FDIC chairman Bill Seidman, who had served as finance chair for Romney''s father when he ran for president in 1968.\nThe federal documents also reveal that, contrary to Romney''s claim that he returned full time to Bain Capital in 1992, he remained involved in bailout negotiations to the very end. In a letter dated March 23rd, 1993, Romney reassured creditors that his latest scheme would return Bain & Company to "long-term financial stability." That same month, Romney once again threatened to "pay out maximum bonus distributions" to top executives unless much of Bain''s debt was erased.\nIn the end, the government surrendered. At the time, The Boston Globe cited bankers dismissing the bailout as "relatively routine" – but the federal documents reveal it was anything but. The FDIC agreed to accept nearly $5 million in cash to retire $15 million in Bain''s debt – an immediate government bailout of $10 million. All told, the FDIC estimated it would recoup just $14 million of the $30 million that Romney''s firm owed the government.\nIt was a raw deal – but Romney''s threat to loot his own firm had left the government with no other choice. If the FDIC had pushed Bain into bankruptcy, the records reveal, the agency would have recouped just $3.56 million from the firm.\nThe Romney campaign refused to respond to questions for this article; a spokeswoman said only that "Mitt Romney turned around Bain & Company by getting all parties to come to the table and make difficult decisions." But while taxpayers did not finance the bailout, the debt forgiven by the government was booked as a loss to the FDIC – and then recouped through higher insurance premiums from banks. And banks, of course, are notorious for finding ways to pass their costs along to customers, usually in the form of higher fees. Thanks to the nature of the market, in other words, the bailout negotiated by Romney ultimately wound up being paid by the American people.\nEven as consumers took a loss, however, a small group of investors wound up getting a good deal in the bailout. Bain Capital – the very firm that had triggered the crisis in the first place – walked away with $4 million. That was the fee it charged Bain & Company for loaning the consulting firm the services of its chief executive – one Willard Mitt Romney.\nThis story is from the September 13, 2012 issue of Rolling Stone.\nRelated\n• Mitt Romney''s Federal Bailout: The Documents\n• Greed and Debt: The True Story of Mitt Romney and Bain Capital\n• Right-Wing Billionaires Behind Mitt Romney\n• How the GOP Became the Party of the Rich\nTo read the new issue of Rolling Stone online, plus the entire RS archive: Click Here', '<div><div id="storyTextContainer"><div><div><div>\n			    \n	\n		</div></div></div><div><div><img alt="" src="http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/story/the-federal-bailout-that-saved-mitt-romney-20120829/1000x600/20120827-mitt-romney-03-x600-1346105278.jpg"></img></div><p>Mitt Romney</p><p> JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GettyImages</p></div><div id="contentInfo"><p>August 29, 2012 7:00 AM ET</p></div><p><span>M</span>itt Romney likes to say he won''t "apologize" for his success in business. But what he never says is "thank you" &ndash; to the American people &ndash; for the federal bailout of Bain &amp; Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible.</p><p>According to the candidate''s mythology, Romney took leave of his duties at the private equity firm Bain Capital in 1990 and rode in on a white horse to lead a swift restructuring of Bain &amp; Company, preventing the collapse of the consulting firm where his career began. When <em>The Boston Globe</em> reported on the rescue at the time of his Senate run against Ted Kennedy, campaign aides spun Romney as the wizard behind a "long-shot miracle," bragging that he had "saved bank depositors all over the country $30 million when he saved Bain &amp; Company."</p><p>In fact, government documents on the bailout obtained by <em>Rolling Stone</em> show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie. The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney''s initial rescue attempt at Bain &amp; Company was actually a disaster &ndash; leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had "no value as a going concern." Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC &ndash; the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers &ndash; out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds.</p><p>With his selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Romney has made fiscal stewardship the centerpiece of his campaign. A banner at MittRomney.com declared, "We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in." Romney also opposed the federal bailout for Detroit automakers, famously arguing that the industry should be forced into bankruptcy. Government bailouts, he insists, are "the wrong way to go."</p><p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/../../../politics/blogs/national-affairs/mitt-romney-is-lying-again-20120830">More: Romney Is Lying. Again.</a></p><p>But the FDIC documents on the Bain deal &ndash; which were heavily redacted by the firm prior to release &ndash; show that as a wealthy businessman, Romney was willing to go to extremes to secure a federal bailout to serve his own interests. He had a lot at stake, both financially and politically. Had Bain &amp; Company collapsed, insiders say, it would have dealt a grave setback to Bain Capital, where Romney went on to build a personal fortune valued at as much as $250 million. It would also have short-circuited his political career before it began, tagging Romney as a failed businessman unable to rescue his own firm.</p><p>"None of us wanted to see Bain be the laughingstock of the business world," recalls a longtime Romney lieutenant who asked not to be identified. "But Mitt''s reputation was on the line."</p><p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/../../../politics/pictures/mitt-romneys-federal-bailout-the-documents-20120829">Mitt Romney''s Federal Bailout: The Documents</a></p><p><span>T</span>he trouble began in 1984, when Bain &amp; Company spun off Bain Capital to engage in leveraged buyouts and put Romney in charge of the new operation. To free up money to invest in the new business, founder Bill Bain and his partners cashed out much of their stock in the consulting firm &ndash; leaving it saddled with about $200 million in debt. (Romney, though not a founder, reportedly profited from the deal.) "People will tell you that Bill raped the place clean, was greedy, didn''t know when to stop," a former Bain consultant later conceded. "Did they take too much out of the firm? You bet."</p><p>The FDIC documents make clear what happened next: "Soon after the founders sold their equity," analysts reported, "business began to drop off." First came scandal: In the late 1980s, a Bain consultant became a key figure in an illegal stock manipulation scheme in London. The firm''s reputation took a hit, and it fired 10 percent of its consulting force. By the time the 1989 recession began, Bain &amp; Company found itself going broke fast. Cash flows weren''t enough to service the debt imposed by the founders, and the firm could barely make payroll. In a panic, Bill Bain tapped Romney, his longtime prot&eacute;g&eacute;, to take the reins.                \n                                \n            </p></div><p>To read the new issue of <em>Rolling Stone</em> online, plus the entire RS archive: <a href="http://archive.rollingstone.com/" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p></div><div><div id="storyTextContainer"><div><div><div>\n			    \n	\n		</div></div></div><p>In Romney''s own retelling, he casts himself as a selfless and loyal company man. "There was no upside," he told his cheerleading biographer Hugh Hewitt in 2007. "There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great things for me."</p><p>In fact, Romney had a direct stake in the survival of Bain &amp; Company: He had been working to build the Bain brand his entire career, and felt he had to save the firm at all costs. After all, Bain sold top-dollar strategic advice to big businesses about how to protect themselves from going bust. If Bain &amp; Company went bankrupt, recalls the Romney deputy, "anyone associated with them would have looked clownish." Indeed, when a banker from Goldman Sachs urged Bain to consider bankruptcy as the obvious solution to the firm''s woes, Romney''s desperation began to show. He flatly refused to discuss it &ndash; and in the ensuing argument, one witness says, Romney almost ended up in a brawl when the Goldman banker advised him to "go fuck yourself." For the sake of Romney''s career and fortune, bankruptcy was simply not an option &ndash; no matter who got screwed in the process.</p><p><span>A</span>ccording to the government records obtained by <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Bain &amp; Company "defaulted on its debt obligations" at nearly the same time that "W. Mitt Romney . . . stepped in as managing director (and later chief executive) in 1990 and led the financial restructuring intended to get the firm back on track."</p><p>Romney moved decisively, and his early efforts appeared promising. He persuaded the founders to return $25 million of the cash they had raided from Bain &amp; Company and forgive $75 million in debt, in return for protection from most future liabilities. Romney then consolidated Bain''s massive debts into a single, binding loan agreement with four banks, which received liens on Bain''s assets and agreed to delay repayments on the firm''s debts for two years. The federal government also signed off on the deal, since the FDIC had recently taken control of a bank that was owed $30.6 million by Bain. Romney assured creditors that the restructuring would enable Bain to "operate normally, compensate its professionals competitively" and, ultimately, pay off its debts.</p><p>Almost as soon as the FDIC agreed to the loan restructuring, however, Romney''s rescue plan began to fall apart. "The company realized early on that it would be unable to hit its revenue targets or manage the debt structure," the documents reveal. By the spring of 1992, Bain''s decline was perilous: "If Bain goes into default," one analyst warned the FDIC, "the bank group will need to decide whether to force Bain into bankruptcy."</p><p>With his rescue plan a bust, Romney was forced to slink back to the banks to negotiate a new round of debt relief. There was only one catch: Even though Bain &amp; Company was deep in debt and sinking fast, the firm was actually flush with cash &ndash; most of it from the looted money that Bill Bain and other partners had given back. "Liquidity is strong based on the significant cash balance which Bain is carrying," one federal document reads.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, such ample reserves would have made liquidating Bain an attractive option: Creditors could simply divvy up the stockpiled cash and be done with the troubled firm. But Bain had inserted a poison pill in its loan agreement with the banks: Instead of being required to use its cash to pay back the firm''s creditors, the money could be pocketed by Bain executives in the form of fat bonuses &ndash; starting with VPs making $200,000 and up. "The company can deplete its cash balances by making officer-bonus payments," the FDIC lamented, "and still be in compliance with the loan documents."</p><p>What''s more, the bonus loophole gave Romney a perverse form of leverage: If the banks and the FDIC didn''t give in to his demands and forgive much of Bain''s debts, Romney would raid the firm''s coffers, pushing it into the very bankruptcy that the loan agreement had been intended to avert. The losers in this game would not only be Bain''s creditors &ndash; including the federal government &ndash; but the firm''s nearly 1,000 employees worldwide.</p><p><span>I</span>n March 1992, according to the FDIC documents, Romney approached the banks and played the bonus card.

People were like, “I have stuff to get done, it''s Thursday, so I''m gonna work Friday and just get it done. But we actually preferred that they didn''t. There are very few things that can''t wait till Monday.\nHow many employees would stay to work Fridays?\n I don''t know.\nBecause you weren''t there!\n We don''t track things in that way. I don''t look at that. I don''t want to encourage that kind of work. I want to encourage quality work.\nAs CEO, wouldn''t it simply be rational to let people work the fifth day for you if they wanted?\n If you''re a short-term thinker you''d think so, but we''re long-term thinkers. We''re about being in business for the long haul and keeping the team together over the long haul. I would never trade a short-term burst for a long-term decline in morale. That happens a lot in the tech business: They burn people out and get someone else. I like the people who work here too much. I don''t want them to burn out. Lots of startups burn people out with 60, 70, 80 hours of work per week. They know that both the people or the company will flame out or be bought or whatever, and they don''t care, they just burn their resources. It''s like drilling for as much oil as you possibly can. You can look at people the same way.She''s on her own, she cleans people''s homes, she''s incredibly nice. She brings flowers every time she cleans, and she''s just respectful and nice and awesome. Why can''t more people be like that?\nAre we reaching “peak people”?\n It seems like in a lot of companies we are. There''s a shortage of talent out there, and if there''s a shortage of resources, you want to conserve those resources.\nSo you think there''s a slash-and-burn mentality in the tech world?\n For sure. I think there''s a lot of lottery-playing going on right now. Companies staffing up, raising a bunch of money, hiring a bunch of people, and burning them out in the hopes that they''ll hit the lottery.\nYou seem like too nice a guy to name names--but do you have certain companies in mind?\n I won''t name names. I used to name names. But I think all you have to do is read TechCrunch. Look at what the top stories are, and they''re all about raising money, how many employees they have, and these are metrics that don''t matter. What matters is: Are you profitable? Are you building something great? Are you taking care of your people? Are you treating your customers well? In the coverage of our industry as a whole, you''ll rarely see stories about treating customers well, about people building a sustainable business. TechCrunch to me is the great place to look to see the sickness in our industry right now.\nOur magazine is called Fast Company, but it sounds like you want to build a slow company.\n I''m a fan of growing slowly, carefully, methodically, of not getting big just for the sake of getting big. I think that rapid growth is typically of symptom of... there''s a sickness there. There''s a great quote by a guy named Ricardo Semler, author of the book Maverick. He said that only two things grow for the sake of growth: businesses and tumors. We have 35 employees at 37signals. We could have hundreds of employees if we wanted to--our revenues and profits support that--but I think we''d be worse off.\nWhat industries do you look to for inspiration, if not the tech world?\n I take my inspiration from small mom-and-pop businesses that have been around for a long time. There are restaurants all over the place that I like to go to that have been around a long time, 30 years or more, and thinking about that, that''s an incredible run. I don''t know what percentage of tech companies have been around 30 years. The other interesting thing about restaurants is you could have a dozen Italian restaurants in the city and they can all be successful. It''s not like in the tech world, where everyone wants to beat each other up, and there''s one winner. Those are the businesses I find interesting--it could be a dry cleaner, a restaurant, a clothing store. Actually, my cleaning lady, for example, she''s great.\nYour business icon is your cleaning lady?\n She''s on her own, she cleans people''s homes, she''s incredibly nice. She brings flowers every time she cleans, and she''s just respectful and nice and awesome. Why can''t more people be like that? She''s been doing it some twenty-odd years, and that''s just an incredible success story. To me that''s far more interesting than a tech company that''s hiring a bunch of people, just got their fourth round of financing for 12 million dollars, and they''re still losing money. That''s what everyone talks about as being exciting, but I think that''s an absolutely disgusting scenario when it comes to business.\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.

We could have hundreds of employees if we wanted to--our revenues and profits support that--but I think we&rsquo;d be worse off.</p><p><strong>What industries do you look to for inspiration, if not the tech world?<br></br>\n</strong><br></br>\nI take my inspiration from small mom-and-pop businesses that have been around for a long time. There are restaurants all over the place that I like to go to that have been around a long time, 30 years or more, and thinking about that, that&rsquo;s an incredible run. I don&rsquo;t know what percentage of tech companies have been around 30 years. The other interesting thing about restaurants is you could have a dozen Italian restaurants in the city and they can all be successful. It&rsquo;s not like in the tech world, where everyone wants to beat each other up, and there&rsquo;s one winner. Those are the businesses I find interesting--it could be a dry cleaner, a restaurant, a clothing store. Actually, my cleaning lady, for example, she&rsquo;s great.</p><p><strong>Your business icon is your cleaning lady?<br></br>\n</strong><br></br>\nShe&rsquo;s on her own, she cleans people&rsquo;s homes, she&rsquo;s incredibly nice. She brings flowers every time she cleans, and she&rsquo;s just respectful and nice and awesome. Why can&rsquo;t more people be like that? She&rsquo;s been doing it some twenty-odd years, and that&rsquo;s just an incredible success story. To me that&rsquo;s far more interesting than a tech company that&rsquo;s hiring a bunch of people, just got their fourth round of financing for 12 million dollars, and they&rsquo;re still losing money. That&rsquo;s what everyone talks about as being exciting, but I think that&rsquo;s an absolutely disgusting scenario when it comes to business.</p><p><em>This interview has been condensed and edited.
